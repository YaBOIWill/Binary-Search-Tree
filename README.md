# Binary-Search-Tree

Create a Binary Search Tree with the following elements in the order mentioned below:

5, 85, 89, 3, 2, 8, 65, 92

 

Print the Pre-order of this tree
   

Print the height and the balance factor of the nodes in the order they were inserted (5, 85, 89, 3, 2, 8, 65, 92) in the form of a table with three columns and 9 rows. Use column headers “Node”, “Height”, and “Balance Factor” for the three columns respectively. Use the following table as reference for your output. Don't worry about printing the table borders.  Note: You are not balancing the tree. You are just computing the heights and balance factors of a BST.
